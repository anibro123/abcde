		Define the Interface:
	•	Define the procedures or methods that will be accessible remotely.
	•	Specify parameters and return types for each procedure.
		Implement the Server:
	•	Implement the procedures defined in the interface.
	•	Start a server process that listens for incoming RPC requests.
	•	When a request is received, execute the corresponding procedure and return the result.
		Implement the Client:
	•	Create a client program that can send RPC requests to the server.
	•	Provide a mechanism for specifying the server address and port.
	•	Provide functions or methods that allow the client to call remote procedures.
		Serialization/Deserialization:
	•	Define a protocol for serializing procedure calls and parameters into a format that can be transmitted over the network (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers).
	•	Define a protocol for deserializing the response from the server.
		Network Communication:
	•	Establish a connection between the client and server (e.g., using TCP/IP).
	•	Send the serialized RPC request from the client to the server.
	•	Receive the serialized response from the server and deserialize it.
		Error Handling:
	•	Handle network errors, timeouts, and other communication failures.
	•	Define error codes or exceptions to indicate remote procedure call failures.
		Security (Optional):
	•	Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized clients can access remote procedures.
	•	Use encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over the network.
